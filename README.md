After a few days of figuring things out, finally my hackintosh with macOS Ventura is working.

Exact laptop model: HP Envy x360 15-w103ng, here you can find the details https://support.hp.com/ee-en/document/c04841620

Most important info: i5 Skylake with officially unsupported iGPU Intel HD 520 (but works with a spoof as Kabylake HD 620).

Obviously, you should change the SMB data to have one unique to your machine.

Hope it saves someone time while setting up a similar machine.
